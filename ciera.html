            <span class="project-subtitle">Confidence Chats with Friends</span>
            <p> V: Alright so here we go, the first question is, do any of you use social media, and if so state social media that you use?</p>

            <p>C: I use Instagram and Tik Tok.
            </p>
            <p>V: So my next question is then, do you experience confidence on a day to day basis, would you like to say that you're a pretty confident person?
            </p>
            <p>C: I feel like I'm 50/50 Sometimes I can really be my own best friend and sometimes I can be such a bitch to myself.
            </p>
            <p>V: Okay, so then relating it back to social media, do you feel like social media, either helps or hinders your confidence?
            </p>
            <p>C: I feel like social media can hinder my confidence if I'm not super careful about how I am going through it and thinking about it. So like if I don't go into it with the positive mindspace if I'm going on here to see cool things and
              discover cool things, then I can get into a comparison mindset and that's when it's not good for my confidence.
            </p>
            <p>V:So when I was taking your picture would you say that you felt pretty confident?
            </p>
            <p>C: No, because my friends were making fun of me [during the shoot haha]. Um, I think I felt confident yes because I'm wearing bright colors and I always feel good when I'm wearing my bright colors, and I was in a comfortable space,
              which always helps.
            </p>
            <p>V: Okay this question is a little bit more personal, if you do have confidence, or if you don't have confidence, where do you think that kind of stems from like within you?
            </p>
            <p>C: I think that my confidence comes from just realizing that if I'm not confident about myself and my abilities and my looks like no one else is gonna do it for me so I might as well be my number one supporter, and, like, it's just a
              lot easier to wake up in the morning and have confidence in yourself, because I just got really tired of waking up and hating myself. So I decided to be my, my own best friend because it's just like you can't. Nobody else is going to do
              it for you, you might be lucky enough to have a friend or family who is there to pump you up, but in the end, it's just you and yourself.
            </p>
            <p>V: Alright and then my last question is for people who are struggling with self confidence, what is some advice that's really gotten you to a point where you feel confident that you wanna share?
            </p>
            <p>C: Okay, so this is what I think I was first told to become confident, and I no longer use this, but I think it was a good beginning step is I was told to treat myself how I treat my friends and I will gas up my friends are will give
              them grace, I will constantly look at them in such an admiring way because I think my friends are incredible. But I was not doing that to myself. So I think that's like a good place to start is think about the things that you're saying
              to yourself and like would you say that to your friend, probably not. Um, but then I recommend not staying there because you don't want to have confidence only driven by other people. Once you like are able to be in a habit of being
              confident that's what it's like okay now, take a step and like- I guess the biggest thing was when someone told me that no one else was going to do it for me. No one else was going to give me confidence, no one else was gonna hype me up
              as much as I probably like the way that I want to be hyped up or like the way that I need to feel I'm the one who I'm stuck with all the time so if no one else is gonna do it for you. Do it for yourself.
