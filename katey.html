            <p>V: Do you use social media?
            </p>
            <p>K: Yes.
            </p>
            <p>V: Okay. What platforms?
            </p>
            <p>K: I use Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
            </p>
            <p>V: Sweet. And do you post about yourself often on those platforms?
            </p>
            <p>K: No
            </p>
            <p>V: Would you say that you experience confidence on a day to day basis?
            </p>
            <p>K: Yeah.
            </p>
            <p>V: Okay, so can you like, you know, narrow that down like say like, maybe a few things that bring you confidence?
            </p>
            <p>K: Yeah, I feel confident when I can pick out the outfits I wear and when I do my makeup fun and sometimes I just wake up feeling confident.
            </p>
            <p>V: So how would you say that social media has affected your confidence?
            </p>
            <p>K: Definitely you can get little minor, temporary boosts of confidence from posting a picture that you like of yourself and getting positive reinforcement from your friends through likes, but that's not really lasting confidence, that
              has to come from within.
            </p>
            <p>V: Do you feel like there's a reason why you may not post about yourself as much on social media?
            </p>
            <p>K: Yeah, I think, especially during quarantine I just haven't felt like anything I was doing was worth posting about. Like when I was in Italy, I would post a lot, because I felt like that was kinda cool but now I've just been living
              my everyday life and it’s a little less interesting maybe
            </p>
            <p>V: Do you think that in general, social media has impacted people's confidence, and in what ways?
            </p>
            <p>K: I think social media can control people's confidence unfortunately, they don't get enough likes or comments or something that can just completely ruin their day. So I think that social media unfortunately has the power to build up
              and tear down people's confidence, depending on how many likes they get on a certain picture and what their expectations are for themselves and how they're comparing themselves to others. I think that it can really negatively affect
              people's confidence.
            </p>
            <p>V: So what is one piece of advice you would give to someone who's struggling with confidence issues?
            </p>
            <p>K: I would say it's really difficult but try to compare yourself to others less, because I think that that's where most confidence issues come; it's mostly just comparing yourself to other people. And I do it all the time too and it's
              hard not to, but if at least you have a small voice in you that can say that, what other people look like or what other people are doing doesn't matter- I think that that's at least good enough to remind yourself once in a while.
            </p>
            <p>V: How has body positivity movement affected you?
            </p>
            <p>K: I like it. And I think that it helps a lot of people with accepting their own image. And I know that representation is really important, because if you don't see people who look like you, in the media, especially getting likes or
              recognition, it can be something that’s really disheartening. So I think that the body positivity movement has really given the spotlight to people of all different sizes and colors and heights I guess, so it's pretty cool. Just to have
              the representation.
            </p>
            <p>V: And then my last question is did you feel confident while I was taking the picture?
            </p>
            <p>K: Yeah, I think I felt pretty confident...today was a day where I woke up feeling not as confident so maybe not haha. I didn't do my makeup. But I still think I look pretty. And I like my hat. My hat gives me confidence. Makes me feel
              strong.
