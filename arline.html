            <span class="project-subtitle">Confidence Chats with Random Strangers</span>
            <p> V: This project is all about confidence and where it comes from and how that also ties into social media and a little bit of how that may affect your confidence from time to time, especially with quarantine and social media being
              really the only form of communication we have. So that is what my project is trying to analyze through photography and getting to talk to people and getting their insight on if they feel confident on the day-to-day basis or not, and
              where that comes from.</p>

            <p>A: Overall I would say that I’m a pretty confident person I’d say a lot of that came from just like parent support and sibling support, we’ve all been really close and we just kinda build each other up. If someone wants to do
              something
              we all support them in that venture, and my parents always pushed us to do what we want to do. I’ve been managing Stem, we’ve been open for seven years.</p>

            <p>V: What is Stem?</p>

            <p>A: It’s a cidery, so it’s a taproom. Both the owners are amazing, it’s two guys and they support me and everything I want to do here so I have a lot of confidence in my work which helps too. I think a lot that just kinda comes from
              the
              people around you, supporting you and also telling you the things you’re doing have value and you can kinda see that. I actually kind chose not to be apart of social media that much; I have a facebook but I hardly look at it and I
              don’t
              have an Instagram because a huge part of that is because it does bother me that so much of it has become negative and I don’t feel like there’s room for that. So instead I can maintain relationships through phone calls and text
              messages
              and stuff and I keep facebook for people who I don’t live by as much, but again I don’t look at it that much. But it is something I definitely worry about with my younger cousins watching stuff like that, and that type of thing I
              don’t
              know. I just feel like it’s dangerous because people are a lot more likely to say things if they don’t have the other person there.</p>

            <p>V: Do you feel like social media has affected the confidence or mental health of people you know?</p>

            <p>A: I could say confidence, just like in both ways to be honest because I some have friends that have used it to help build their businesses and to showcase their art, and use it for something to show how they are succeeding but then
              there are some instances where instead- and I think that's also the people you surround yourself by taking out those negative people on your social media. So yeah, I’ve kinda seen it go both ways, I think it’s more the negative part
              unfortunately for the younger kinds, like middle school and high school because kids will be kids and when they say little snarky comments like that and instead its in writing and not something that just goes away and I think that
              kinda
              hurts them more, and makes it a little harder for them.</p>
