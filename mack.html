              <p>V: Do you have social media</p>

              <p>M: I do, I have instagram, i have facebook, I have a pinterest…does that count? What else is there? I don’t have twitter, oh tiktok!
              </p>
              <p>V:Do you post about yourself on those platforms very often
              </p>
              <p>M: I do not post very often and I, I don't know ya, I never really post on Facebook or TikTok and I will occasionally post on instagram, but other than that I’m not really a regular poster
              </p>
              <p>V: Do you feel like there's a reason why?
              </p>
              <p>M: I feel like, I overthink a lot of stuff and like I will get scared whenever I post stuff, or I feel like I don’t have anything good to put out I guess.
              </p>
              <p>V: What are some of your hobbies?
              </p>
              <p>M: Some of my hobbies are I sew sometimes, I like bugs or I guess just animals in general, my major is actually [evolutionary] biology so... I’m into films too my minor is film, so I like making films, I like animating, I like my
                dog
                hahaha
              </p>
              <p>V: I would argue to say that is content, so do you feel that social media, or at least the atmosphere it creates sometimes ever stops you from sharing?
              </p>
              <p>M: Ya, I feel like I constantly see other people's feeds and I can easily compare myself and that's a big blight of social media. I’m also a bit of a private person compared to others so I find it a bit hard to share especially
                with
                these people- like a lot of the people I’m friends with on social media are people I was friends with in high school or random people so I don’t know it’s weird. I feel like I think about this a lot though, I wish I could put myself
                out
                there more on social media to kind of create an image of how I'd like to see myself but it’s hard because I feel like there are still barriers for me just because of insecurities.
              </p>
              <p>V: Do you feel confidence on a day to day basis?
              </p>
              <p>M: Not really, yeah no.
              </p>
              <p>V: Can you pinpoint a time where you felt most confident?
              </p>
              <p>M: When I worked at [summer camp] after freshman year, I felt like it was a very safe place to be with a small amount of people it wasn’t like we were at college where you have to dress to impress and stuff so I felt like it was
                very
                easy to feel comfortable and I left that summer feeling very strong. I felt like I had built muscles and just felt really good about my body and about my relationships as well. And everyone was very reaffirming there you know like
                we
                would always be doing camp songs or stuff like that and everyone was very nice and down to earth and stuff.
              </p>
              <p>V: So human connection and knowing that you were safe and in a place where people loved and accepted you gave you confidence?
              </p>
              <p>M: Yeah, I also feel like it was very disconnected; like there was the aspect of nature so it was kinda like going down to the basics so you didn’t have to worry about homework or social media or whatever. It was just like you have
                these kids you gotta watch out for, and you can read a book or play some sudoku or i dunno it felt very simple and that was very appealing, and everyone was super nice there and wanted to get to know you so that was nice.
              </p>
              <p>V: Do you ever feel confident on social media?
              </p>
              <p>M: Not really, I feel like that's the issue I have with posting is that I don't feel the confidence to actually post I guess because of fear. For so long I’ve been trying to get into the mentality that nobody gives a shit and it
                doesn’t matter but I haven't really been able to find myself there. I'm trying to get there, it's just really hard. You have to remind yourself constantly; it does feel like living in college in Boulder it feels like a bubble and
                everyone knows each other and kinda scary to put yourself out there
              </p>
              <p>V: Did you feel confident when I was taking your picture?
              </p>
              <p>M: Yeah, I feel like whenever friends take pictures of me I feel pretty good like that boosts my confidence and I forget sometimes how much fun it is to pose in front of a camera. But I know you [Victoria] really well so I think
                that
                really helps. Like if somebody in my film class was like I’m gonna film you for my project I would get really awkward, and I feel like it’s very hard to just be vulnerable...I don’t know there’s so much emphasis put on posing and
                modeling and acting that it's scary to do that in front of strangers; I know I’m capable of it I’ve done it for peoples projects and I can do it well but it's still scary.
