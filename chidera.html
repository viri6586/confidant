            <p> V: Alright so here we go, the first question is, do any of you use social media, and if so state social media that you use?</p>

            <p> C: I use Twitter. Instagram is not that- I don't consider that a social media that I use but I do technically use TikTok.</p>

            <p> V: So my next question is then, do you experience confidence on a day to day basis, would you like to say that you're a pretty confident person?</p>

            <p> C: I don't think I look better than a lot of people but I know that I am better than a lot of people.</p>

            <p> V: Okay, so then relating it back to social media, do you feel like social media, either helps or hinders your confidence?</p>

            <p> C: In terms of appearances I think social media does a really good job of making you feel lesser than, at least for me, because it's like wow everyone here is so gorgeous and here I'm not. But on the other, like track, it's the reason
              why I know that I'm better than some people because a lot of people say the dumbest things on social media and I would never.
            </p>
            <p> V:So when I was taking your picture would you say that you felt pretty confident?
            </p>
            <p> C: Yeah, I think that photo shoots are always kind of awkward because it's like, though it's, it's a time when you are very personally aware of how you look because you know that someone is literally taking your photo, worth of photos
              being taken. And so I think that being in a space with a bunch of other cool people who are also getting their photos taken really helps with that because they can kind of distract you from kind of awkwardness and like insecurity of it
              all.
            </p>
            <p> V: Okay so this question is a little bit more personal, if you do have confidence, or if you don't have confidence, where do you think that kind of stems from like within you?
            </p>
            <p> C: I think confidence and also lack of confidence kind of stem from this, like you're saying like social media has given us this tool to be more connected than ever before, but it also allows for us to get involved in false
              perceptions of what things are. We can project a lot and be like, oh look at that person they seem so confident and self-assured, why don't I then feel confidence or self-assures without realizing that it's not something you can just
              throw on like a jacket and be like well I'm confident and self assured. It is a lifelong journey and also it is not an easy one. And I think that perception of, we assume that it's easy for other people makes it harder for us to be easy
              on ourselves and I think for me that's kind of like the biggest thing is recognizing that confidence, always takes time, it takes effort it takes introspection, it takes a lot of work and just making sure that you're always constantly
              doing the work, even if some days you feel worse than others know that a day will come when you will feel self assured enough to always, not to not always feel good but to know that there a day will come when you will feel better.
            </p>
            <p> V: Alright and then my last question is for people who are struggling with self confidence, what is some advice that's really gotten you to a point where you feel confident that you wanna share?
            </p>
            <p> C: Okay, well, I think that the way that you get confidence, at least for me, was through community. It's very easy to be hypercritical of yourself, but I know that they say like you can't often rely on what other people say about you
              but I think that like, we're like social beings, and we get a lot of our validation and comfort and support from other people and I think that that is a really good way to kind of approach confidence. You don't have to always be
              confident in yourself, but you can be confident in your friends and those around you who support you, to see the things in you that you can't quite see in yourself, and so I kind of used that to be like look I may not think that I look
              great, but I know my friends would never lie to me about the way I look, or the way I present myself, or the way that I am as a person, so I use that to kind of like motivate myself to keep moving forward. I mean, I may never be able to
              see it, but I know that it's there, because I know that they see it in me.
