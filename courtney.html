            <p>V: Alright so here we go, the first question is, do any of you use social media, and if so state social media that you use?
            </p>
            <p>C: I use Instagram and Twitter.
            </p>
            <p>V: So my next question is then, do you experience confidence on a day to day basis, would you like to say that you're a pretty confident person?
            </p>
            <p>C: I am not a confident person whatsoever.
            </p>
            <p>V: Okay, so then relating it back to social media, do you feel like social media, either helps or hinders your confidence?
            </p>
            <p>C: Um, I think that social media definitely makes me a little less confident like- I mean it feels really good to get validation, you know, from, like, you know, you get a lot of likes and comments but it also makes me feel kind of
              small sometimes where like, you know, you might see somebody else who gets even more likes and more comments and you’re like, wow, everybody's paying attention to this person who's paying attention to me. Even though you have people in
              real life who were really paying attention to you
            </p>
            <p>V:So when I was taking your picture would you say that you felt pretty confident?
            </p>
            <p>C: Um, I wouldn't say that I was like, particularly like I wasn't any more confident than I normally am I was just having a good time. So I wouldn't attribute it to confidence so much as just like being around good people.
            </p>
            <p>V: Okay so this question is a little bit more personal, if you do have confidence, or if you don't have confidence, where do you think that kind of stems from like within you?
            </p>
            <p>C: Um, I would say like my lack of confidence definitely stems from like one person in my past, who's like, you know, they weren’t very nice to me, to put it in nice terms, I guess, and they were constantly like judging me and putting
              me down so you know, it was like no matter what, I couldn't win. So now I'm like, oh, like everybody can see me I look so bad, damn like people think I look so bad, and nobody's really looking at you like that. Everybody's thinking
              about themselves, which is a good thing, you know, like you just you can't help but like, feel like, oh my god I just want to go home like people can see me like they think I'm so stupid.
            </p>
            <p>V: Alright and then my last question is for people who are struggling with self confidence, what is some advice that's really gotten you to a point where you feel confident that you wanna share?
            </p>
            <p>C: Um, I will say like, as cliche as it sounds like it's definitely was a thing of like stop doubting yourself type thing, you know, as a black woman, you look for content for you, for black women and then you only find like you know
              like the light skin like loose curls type of person and like you kind of have to understand that, maybe that's not ever going to be you and that's fine because you're you, and who else is? But, I used to watch, you know videos of people
              doing their hair really cool and their makeup really cool and so I was like why can't I do that? So I just totally like immersing myself in something that I've always wanted to do and, you know, I got good at it and I realized that it
              was something that I really really like. And so I just kind of do it for fun now. And that brings me a little bit of confidence, I'm like wow, I have a talent, yeah!
